# mancala
A Mancala game created with two teammates. Made with TAMU students:

My role was creating the GUI (All the fxml files) and getting the buttons, menus and dynamic values (like score) to update. I was also responsible for the commenting and the organization of the code to ensure that didn't look like mom's spaghetti. I rearranged all the code to group together similar functions and features.
